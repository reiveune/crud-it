You can unzip the file "other_table_css_files.zip" to reveal other css files which can be used for display purposes. There 
are also hundreds of fun css files which will work here - http://icant.co.uk/csstablegallery

To Replace the CSS file you can either:
1) Replace default.css with any of the other css files, or 
2) Use the setCSSFile function (http://ajaxcrud.com/api/index.php?id=setCSSFile) to pull it in dynamically


Any questions or issues: online support and reference material is on the website.
