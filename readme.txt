This project was first an attempt to add PDO and UTF-8 support to AjaxCRUD. I used it for my personnal project and it growed to become a small and usefull framework: - i18n - WYSIWYG - Form validation functions 



Below : the original readme file

1) To install this class you must first manually CREATE a database. This is done (locally) by going
   into your mySQL terminal window and using the SQL "CREATE DATABASE [database_name]".

   If you are using an online host, you'll have to go into its control panel (eg C-panel) and create a database.

2) Make sure a database user has complete access to the database in question (SELECT, UPDATE, CREATE, DELETE)

3) Edit the file "database.php" and fill in your database information

4) Navigate to the file "install.php"

5) Navigate to the file "example.php" to test out the class!!
